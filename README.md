## BoxInvaders: a lightweight, familiar desktop game ##

This is a game that I work on in my spare time. The premise is super simple; you're a box that's trying to avoid being hit by other boxes. I utilized poymorphism to encapsulate similar behaviour in a class which can then be extended to other classes. This reduced code duplication and made my life a lot easier. Below is a screenshot of the game in action!

<strong>BoxInvaders</strong> is still very much a game in progress, so feel free to try it out on your own and have some fun with it!
